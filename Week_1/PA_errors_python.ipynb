        "As you work through this PA, you will encounter some code that does not work as you want it to.  Don't despair!  Errors (when R is unable to run your code) and bugs (when the code doesn't do what you hoped) are a natural part of coding.  Even the best of the best deal with these problems regularly - learning to track down the issue is a skill that you can learn and practice.\n",

        "### Hint 2\n",
